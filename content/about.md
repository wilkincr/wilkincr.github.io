I am currently a Master's student at the University of Michigan studying computer science, graduating in spring 2025. I have experience working on many different areas of artificial intelligence, from traditional machine learning to computer vision to GPU kernel optimization.
Recently, I have been especially interested in building efficient and scalable machine learning systems.

During my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing soccer, and playing card/board games.
